--Before first bridge 
49742, 49115 Trolls in front in Huts Can be Priests or Axe Throwers, outside huts are Axe Throwers
Most Adders can be either and all Serpents can, but there are some complexities as you go on.  Adder/Adder is slightly less common than the other combonations, except when it's not.  Leaving it 50/50 is prolly fine on all 2 packs.
