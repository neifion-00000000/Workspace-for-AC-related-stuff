ZG Research

ZG pack with bats that moves too fast cuz temper was being silly

--Before first bridge DONE
Trolls in front in Huts Can be Priests or Axe Throwers, outside huts are Axe Throwers
All paired snakes can be either type, but there are some complexities on bigger packs.  Adder/Adder is slightly less common than the other combos, except when it's not.  Leaving it 50/50 is prolly fine on all 2 packs.
(3) Bridge Entrance Patrol seen Axe/Priest and Axe/Axe

--After first bridge DONE
49097 needs moved forward
Front Troll can be a Priest or Axe Thrower, Adders can be any combo
Seen 4-5 Crocs (6 Pools)
All Crocs movement is a scripted action that occurs about every 30 seconds, not normal random movement 
Bat pack rotates positions (4 pools)
Headhunter in Hut can also be witchdoctor, in front is always one of each 2 pools of 3  always match the hut directly in front
